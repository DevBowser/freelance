### Client Onboarding

Before you spend too much time on the project, figure out the following: 

* Find out the budget and timeline.
* Figure out the scope.
* Do they currently have a website? How was it built?
* What is the prospective client's objective with the new site?
* How will the client measure success?
* Do they need design alongside development?
* [100+ questions to ask when developing a site](http://marketingland.com/100-questions-you-must-ask-when-developing-web-site-86342)

If you're developing a WordPress site, you should also consider the following:

* It's not about pages, it's about custom templates and features.
* Will they be using this theme for a long time, or potentially changing it in six months?

### Proposals & Quotes

* When writing a proposal, tailor the amount of technical jargon you use.
* Consider quoting a price range instead of a fixed amount. Another option would be quoting different versions of the project -- one with just the basics, one with some enhancements and a third option with all the bells and whistles.
* It's standard to require a 50% deposit before starting work.
* Write up a contract and be sure to be clear about what is and is not included in the deliverables.
* Get EVERYTHING in writing. 

### Accessibility

Similar to brand or style guides, accessibility guides are becoming more popular and commonplace for larger companies. They're a great resource!

### ðŸ”¥Tips

* Take the amount of time you think a project will take and double OR triple it.

* Don't agree to start work on a site until the client has their content together.

* As soon as you start a project, get the communication OUT of your inbox and into a project management tool like [Trello](https://trello.com/), [Basecamp](http://basecamp.com) or [Jumpchart](https://jumpchart.com/).

* Use version control like Github or Bitbucket.

* Make extra money with an affiliate program like [Bluehost](https://www.bluehost.com/hosting/partner) or [WPEngine](http://wpengine.com/affiliate/).
